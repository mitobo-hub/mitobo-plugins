Provides plugins for MiToBo image I/O.
<p>
Here one can find plugins for reading and writing MiToBo images. Compared to 
common ImageJ images MiToBo images contain additional meta data about image
properties. In addition, information about operators applied to an image
are available allowing to reconstruct the whole processing pipeline an image
has run through. 
<p>
Available meta data can be found in an additional XML meta data file which is
saved to disc together with the image. When images are read from disc the 
existence of a meta data file is checked, if available parsed, and the 
meta data is attached to the image where it can be accessed by any plugin or
operator the image is passed to.
