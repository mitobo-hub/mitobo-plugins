Provides plugins for cell membrane and structure detection and analysis.
<p>
This package subsumes plugins useful for analyzing microscopy
images of sub-cellular structures like stress granules and p-bodies. 
In detail, tasks like detecting structures and doing some statistical 
evaluations on the data can be accomplished using the plugins of this 
package. Recently algorithms for cell membrane/tissue detection were
added to facilitate individual assignment of structures to cells.
